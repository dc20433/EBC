        <h4>Day 12: Lukla - Ramechhap - Kathmandu</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        I woke up around 5 AM and heard noises through the thin walls, indicating that many people were up. I knew the airport would be crowded when it reopened, so I quickly packed, checked out without having coffee or breakfast, and headed straight to the airport.
<br /><br />
The sky cleared, and the departure lounge was packed. People stood shoulder-to-shoulder at the check-in counters. There were rumors of eight or nine flights today, but no official announcement was made. I noticed that the airport staff all seemed to be very respectful and responsive to a busy, white-haired Nepali senior, who looked kind since he often wore a smiley face. So, I tried to chat with him when he was near. I asked him whether this type of crowding was unique, or happened all the time. He said it was both unique and a regular occurrence. Next, I asked what he would do at times when hardly any passengers passed through. He did not respond. Once I saw three young backpackers complain to him that they had waited for 2 days to fly out. “We can’t go back to that teahouse for one more night…” uttered one of them, with large teardrops rolling down her cheeks. Later I joked with the senior that managing passengers’ tears was also an item on his job description. The senior seemed to be amused by my commentary.
<br /><br />
The first six planes arrived and departed with all seats filled, mainly with large tour groups. Since I didn't have boarding priority for my flight scheduled for several days later, I started considering a tour guide's suggestion. He assured me that if his clients, whose international flights were three days away, didn't board the plane by 8:30 AM, they would return to Kathmandu and I could join them. The journey involved a day of hiking and two days of jeep-riding. Someone also warned me that after a day of jeep riding, I would feel extremely sore, "as if your bones are falling apart". Just as I was starting to feel hopeless, the seventh plane landed. The senior who I chatted with took my passport and handed it to the ticketing agent, who issued me a boarding pass. He explained that there were no direct flights to Kathmandu that day. He flew me to Ramechhap, where I could take a 5-hour airport shuttle back to Kathmandu. I felt incredibly grateful, but the senior staff member barely acknowledged my gratitude, gave me a smile, and went back to his busy tasks.
<br /><br />
About 30 minutes later I was in the air off to Ramechhap. Kathmandu, you seemed so far away last night, here I come!
