        <h4>Day 12: Lukla - Ramechhap - Kathmandu</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        Around 5AM, through the thin walls I heard noises indicating many were
        up; knowing the seats would be tight if the airport reopened today,
        everyone wanted to be the first at the airport. I also packed, checked
        out without coffee or breakfast, and went straight to the airport.<br /><br />
        Sky cleared and the departure lounge was packed. People stood
        shoulder-to-shoulder at the check-in counters. Words were circulating
        that there would be eight or nine flights today, but no official
        announcement was made. I noticed that the airport staff all seemed to be
        very respectful and responsive to a busy, white-haired Nepali senior,
        who looked kind since he often wore a smiley face. So, I tried to chat
        with him when he was near. I asked him whether this type of crowding was
        unique, or happened all the time? He said unique AND all the time. Next,
        I asked what would he do at times hardly any passenger passing through?
        He did not take that one. Once I saw three young backpackers complain to
        him that they had waited for 2 days to fly out. “We can’t go back to
        that teahouse for one more night…” uttering one of them, with large
        teardrops rolling down her cheeks. Later I joked with the senior that
        managing passengers’ tears was also an item on his job description. He
        gave me an amusing look.<br /><br />
        The first six planes came and left in full; all the seats seemed to have
        been wholesaled to large tour groups. Seeing so many people still
        waiting, and I had no boarding priority because my flight was to be
        several days later, I started mulling over the proposal made by a tour
        guide who comforted me that if by 8:30AM his clients, whose
        international departures were three days away, still had not got on the
        plane, they would hike back to Kathmandu and I was welcome to join them.
        The trip entailed one day of a long hike, followed by two days of
        jeep-ride. (Someone also told me that after one day of the jeep-ride you
        would be so sore as if your bones were falling apart.) Just when despair
        was about to seize on me, the 7th plane landed. The senior took my
        passport and handed it to the ticketing agent, who issued me a boarding
        pass. The senior explained to me there were no direct flights to
        Kathmandu today, and nobody knew whether the airport would be open
        tomorrow, so he flew me to Ramechhap, where I could catch a 5-hour
        airport shuttle back to Kathmandu. Seeing so many people still waiting
        without boarding passes, I couldn’t be more grateful. The senior barely
        heard my gratitude, threw me a smile and went back to his busy
        routines.<br /><br />
        A half an hour later I was in the air off to Ramechhap. Kathmandu, you seemed so far away last night, here I come!<br />
