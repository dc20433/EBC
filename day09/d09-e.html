        <h4>Days 9-11: Gorakshed – Pangboche – Monjo – Lukla</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        The snowstorm continued overnight into the morning, so there was no
        point climbing Kalapattar where no Mount Everest to be seen. Everybody
        was ready to retreat. My partner also decided to leave but couldn’t
        manage to separate from his heavy backpack; he would not be able to keep
        up if he was encumbered by it. I argued that hiring a porter would
        prevent him from being totally exhausted, would contribute to the local
        economy, why not? He had none of it. By the time the last group was
        about to depart, he urged me to join them, who planned to move at a fast
        pace since they only needed to carry their small daypacks; my partner
        wanted to go down with his full luggage at his own pace.<br /><br />
        The youngsters, all anxious to get down, raced in the heavy snow and I
        could barely keep up with them. Although we were backtracking (except a
        portion between Lobuche and Tengboche where we took a parallel route via
        Pheriche instead of going through Dingboche), it did not feel the scenes
        were repeating, because we were oriented to the opposite direction, and
        the landscape was redecorated by the snowfall. It had the feel of a new
        route altogether. The backtrack in this case paid off.<br /><br />
        The first day we rushed 15km/9.5ml, reaching a village called Pangboche
        of 4,000m/13,100ft, and freezing our buns off again that night. The
        snowstorm halted on the second day. The white mountains projecting to
        the turquoise sky presented the unique beauty of the Himalayan
        Mountains. Whe passing through Tengboche, Mount Everest graced us once
        more. I wondered if anyone regretted not go the top of Kalapattar...
        <br /><br />
        We bagged another 14km/9ml, skipping Namche Bazaar and settling at Monjo
        of 2,800m/9,200ft. The resourceful guide took us to a teahouse called
        Summit which created an unforgettable moment for this trip. To our pleasant surprise, it had
        attached bathroom with shower; more pleasant and more surprise was to
        discover there was hot water! This was the first decent hot shower I
        took since leaving Kathmandu 10 days ago. At dinner everyone showed up
        in high spirits as if all gained a new page in life. This was also the
        first time we touched alcohol, to celebrate. That night the room was
        again like an ice cave, but after the hot shower and with a little bit
        of liquor, plus by thinking about tomorrow would be our last night,
        believed everybody slept well.<br /><br />
        The following day we took less than four hours to set foot in Lukla, the
        last stop. No one expected to be greeted by a very bad news: the airport
        had been closed for the last two days due to the weather. Lukla was a
        small place; the cumulation of 3 days’ worth of hikers burst almost all
        the teahouses. Not only returning to Kathmandu by tomorrow was an issue,
        where to stay for the night also became a question. A friendly guide
        made a good effort to find me a room in a teahouse next to the end of
        the runway, otherwise I would spend the night in somebody’s dining
        room.<br /><br />
        Another buns-freezing off/no shower night; but it was worse to think
        about the uncertainty of the remaining trip: Lukla airport was known to
        be closed for days in a time in bad weather. Couldn’t fall asleep that
        night.
