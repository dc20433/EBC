        <h4>Day 2: Phakding - Namche Bazaar</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        Not supposed to be a long day, but it was exhausting. A lot of hills were covered with a heavy bag in tow. Some faraway snow-capped mountains were in sight, and the views were more imposing and spectacular than yesterday. There was much farmland next to the winding trail, and many schoolchildren traversed on the path, which now formed a confluence with a rapidly flowing river down the canyon. Hikers must cross back and forth river 3 times by narrow suspension bridges strung across the canyon, which seemed bottomless; the scary scene was aggravated by the loud sound of gusting mountain winds blowing down from the high mountains, making the bridges sway widely from side to side. Crossing the bridge was daunting, and every time I would fix my eyes on a spot on the backpack of the person in front of me, to counter acrophobia. Thus, not even one photo was taken of me on these bridges. We saw a person trying but failing to get up enough nerves to step on the scariest bridge. We did not know how her trip ended up.
<br /><br />
Over half of the trail, about 4km/2.5ml, was a non-stopping upward climb. Many porters and herds of transportation animals passed us. My partner was a tough hiker who started hiking when he was little. We had partnered to do long hikes once a year for over a decade. This was his third, but my first hike to EBC. Today for some reason he had been struggling at every step, and I started to worry about what to do if he could not make it. I walked ahead of him, stopped when he was about to fall out of sight; and started walking again when he just caught up... By the time we reached Namche, it was getting late. Fortunately, he had been here before, and we quickly found a teahouse he was familiar with.
<br /><br />
Namche Bazaar (3,440m/11,283ft) is situated in a valley on the steep sides of a big mountain, facing several even bigger mountains. The view is unique and stunning. It is the trading center of the Khumbu region where Mount Everest National Park is. Trekking is the only means, other than helicopters, to access the mountains. Several routes into the mountains meet here. Every Saturday is Market Day for locals from all over the region to come to buy and sell crops and produce. There are at least 60 teahouses here where one can take a decent hot shower, charge a phone for free, and the cell signal is strong for net surfing. These would all become an extravagant treat in the deep mountains.<br /><br />
Denver in the U.S. is known to be the Mile-High City, and many visitors may face minor altitude sickness, such as headache and dizziness. Namche Bazaar is exactly 2 miles high. All hikers will take one extra day here to acclimate. Thus, we stayed for 2 nights.
